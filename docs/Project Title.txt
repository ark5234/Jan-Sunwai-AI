Project Title
"Civic-Vision AI": Automated Visual Classification & Geospatial Routing of Civic Grievances using Zero-Shot Learning

1. The Problem Statement
Background: Modern citizens increasingly rely on smartphones to report civic issues. Instead of typing detailed complaints, they prefer taking photos of problems like garbage heaps, potholes, or waterlogging. However, current government portals (like SWAGAT) are text-centric and lack "visual intelligence."

The Specific Gap:

Visual Blindness: Current systems cannot "see" the content of an uploaded image. A photo of a "Mosquito Breeding Site" (VBD Dept) is treated the same as a "Broken Road" (Civil Dept) unless the user manually tags it correctly.

Manual Triage Bottleneck: Government officers must manually open, view, and sort thousands of unlabelled images daily to decide which department handles them, causing significant delays.

User Error: Citizens often misclassify visual evidence (e.g., tagging "Construction Dust" under "Road Dept" instead of "Pollution Control"), leading to tickets bouncing between departments.

Loss of Metadata: Valuable location data (GPS) embedded in photos is often ignored, requiring users to manually type addresses which can be inaccurate.

The Definition: "How can we develop a zero-cost, vision-based AI system that automatically recognizes civic issues from raw user images, routes them to the correct department, and extracts geospatial data without requiring manual user input or expensive model training?"

2. The Proposed Solution (The "Civic-Vision" Architecture)
The proposed system is an Image-First Intelligence Layer. Unlike traditional systems that rely on user text, this system uses Zero-Shot Learning (CLIP) to analyze the visual content of an image directly.

It compares the uploaded photo against a predefined "Knowledge Base" of departmental responsibilities (e.g., "Civil", "Public Health", "VBD", "Pollution") to automatically assign the correct department and priority. It also extracts hidden GPS data to pin the issue on a map.

3. Technical Methodology (The 3-Module Engine)a. Module 1: The Visual Classifier (The "Brain" - CLIP)Technology: OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model (via Hugging Face).Method: Zero-Shot Classification (No training required).Input: A raw image (e.g., a photo of a burning trash pile).The Logic: The system compares the image against a set of descriptive text prompts mapping to your specific dataset classes:"A photo of a broken road or pavement" $\rightarrow$ Civil Dept"A photo of stagnant water or mosquito breeding" $\rightarrow$ VBD Dept"A photo of smoke or air pollution" $\rightarrow$ Pollution Control"A photo of garbage or dead animals" $\rightarrow$ Public HealthOutput: Department: Pollution Control Board | Confidence: 96%b. Module 2: Automated Geotagging (The "GIS" Layer)Technology: Python Pillow (EXIF Data Extraction).Method:The system automatically scans the image file for EXIF Metadata.It extracts the Latitude & Longitude where the photo was taken.It converts these coordinates into a readable address (Reverse Geocoding using OpenStreetMap) to auto-fill the "Location" field for the user.c. Module 3: The Civic Dashboard (The "Interface")Technology: React.js + Leaflet Maps.Function:Visual Grid: Officers see grievances as a visual gallery sorted by urgency, not a text list.Auto-Routing: Tickets are automatically placed in the correct Department bucket (e.g., "Metro Waste" tickets go only to Metro officials).

4. Key Objectives (For your Synopsis)
To implement a Zero-Shot Computer Vision pipeline (using CLIP) capable of classifying civic grievances into 7+ departmental categories (Civil, VBD, Welfare, etc.) without supervised training.

To automate the extraction of geospatial data (GPS coordinates) from user-uploaded images to eliminate manual location entry errors.

To design a low-latency, open-source API (FastAPI) that processes visual evidence and returns classification results in real-time.

To develop a "Visual Grievance Dashboard" that clusters issues by visual similarity and priority for municipal officers.

5. Tools & Technologies (100% Open Source)
AI Model: CLIP (openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) via Hugging Face Transformers.

Backend: FastAPI (Python) - High-performance async framework.

Image Processing: Pillow (PIL) - For resizing and EXIF extraction.

Database: MongoDB (Community Edition) - To store image paths, labels, and JSON metadata.

Frontend: React.js + Leaflet.js (for OpenStreetMap integration).

Deployment: Docker (for containerizing the Python AI service).

also in the second part, after the model analyzes the input image and predicts the correct department and its sub departmnet etc,
I need to make an interface where a user will upload the image, the image will be analyzed automatically by the llm ollama, and will write grevence complaint automatically on the text complaint box in either enhlish or hindi with the name, location of the regiestered user and then the user will upload the complint. Then head of the department will be able to see the grevence compaints related to their respected departments.	

This is a brilliant addition. It shifts the burden from the citizen to the AI. Instead of asking the user to type "I saw a pile of garbage at MG Road," the AI looks at the photo and writes the official complaint letter for them.

This feature is called "Generative Grievance Drafting".

Here is how we integrate this into your Civic-Vision project using Ollama (for the local LLM) and React.

1. The New User Workflow (The "Magic" Experience)
Upload: User opens the app and uploads a photo (e.g., a broken street light).

Analyze (Loading State): The system shows a spinner: "AI is writing your complaint..."

Auto-Fill: The text box automatically fills with a formal complaint:

"Subject: Urgent Repair Required for Street Light in Sector 4. Dear Municipal Officer, I am reporting a non-functional street light at [Extracted Address]. This poses a safety risk at night. Please resolve this. - Reported by [User Name]"

Review: The user edits if needed and hits "Submit".

2. Technical Architecture for "Auto-Writer"
You need a Multimodal LLM (an AI that sees and speaks). Since you are on a "Free/Open Source" constraint, we will use LLaVA (Large Language-and-Vision Assistant) running inside Ollama.

The Stack Update:
Visual Analysis: LLaVA (via Ollama). It is free and runs locally.

Location Extraction: Pillow (EXIF) (as discussed before).

Backend: FastAPI (Python).
